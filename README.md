## pre-commit

Forked from https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit - this allows for files to be modified by pre-commit hooks without 
returning a non-zero exit code, meaning that black and fitness-functions can be ran within the pre-commit process and 
two commits are not necessary.

A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.
